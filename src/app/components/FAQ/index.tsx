                        This invitation-only retreat has gathered a
                        distinguished group of global leaders, including sports
                        executives, world leaders, CEOs, and influential figures
                        across various sectors. Attendees have consistently
                        included owners of roughly 100 professional teams, whose
                        collective business ventures exceed $10 trillion in
                        economic value and whose philanthropic endeavors impact
                        millions globally.

                    <p>
                        Think of this as a retreat, rather than a conference.
                        Spouses and partners are welcome. The off-the-record
                        program is set in a relaxed living-room setting and
                        covers topics ranging from geopolitics, economics,
                        leadership, health, longevity, emerging trends, IP,
                        media, and entertainment. Guests will have the option to
                        participate in diverse activities, and exclusive
                        breakout sessions with speakers. The evenings will be a
                        moment to enjoy good food and great conversation at
                        curated dinners and late night receptions.

                        The event kicks off the afternoon of March 18th with a
                        reception, followed by dinner with a headline speaker.
                        Programming and activities continue on the 19th with
                        early morning breakfasts and activities, programming,
                        dinner, and a late-night reception. Early morning
                        activities, and speakers will continue on the 20th and
                        conclude mid-morning. The full schedule will be
